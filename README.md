In this Project I developed a model so that it helps us to predict the prices of houses based on its features.
I used ML(Machine learning) techniques to train the model.
For this project I took the train and test data set that are available on online (Kaggle Platform).
The predicted values for the new test data are stored in separate file which is solution.csv
